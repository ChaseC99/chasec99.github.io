                Hello there - welcome to my website!
                <br><br>
                My name is Chase Carnaroli and I am an aspiring Software Engineer currently studying Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine.
                <br><br>
                Back in middle school, after seeing a "Learn to Code" campaign, I was inspired to start programming.
                Through Khan Academy's computer programming course, I learned the basics of computer science.
                From there, I started teaching myself programming on and off until my senior year of high school.
                It was then that AP Computer Science was offered for the first time at my school.
                I had a fantastic teacher that year who not only gave me a great foundation for programming, but also helped me fall in love with the field of computer science.
                After taking that class, I knew that I wanted to major in Computer Science and become a software engineer.
                <br><br>
                Since then, I have made several Java applications, a handful of websites, an iOS app, and more - all of which can be seen on my "Projects" page!
                I am now profient in Python, C++, Swift, Java, SQL, and JavaScript;
                although I am constantly trying to learn new languages and build more cool stuff.
                <br><br>
                When I’m not programming, I’m most likely spending time out in nature either hiking, hammocking, playing beach volleyball, or watching the sunset.
                <br><br>
                I have built this website from scratch to show off of my work and to hopefully connect with some cool people. Feel free to reach out and say hello!
